# ROS2 Porting Effort

The current targets are Opensuse Leap 16.0 and Opensuse Tumbleweed and the plan is to skip all of Opensuse 15 and SLES 15.

Once we have ROS2 working on 16.0 and Tumbleweed, we might try porting to Opensuse 15.6 and/or SLES 15 SP7. Opensuse doesnt plan to build a Leap 15.7 so we might only do Opensuse/SLES 15.6 or SLES 15.7.

The current ROS2 distro is Rolling. Once we have a good handle on the Rolling release, we will build stable releases.
